# Malaysia

* Malaysia is great to travel by bus. There is a website/app for that called [Easybook.com](https://www.easybook.com/).
* You won't receive a ticket when you book a bus seat, but only a reservation confirmation. Always be half an hour earlier at the departure station to exchange it to actual ticket.
* Always take estimated ride times with a grain of salt, and add an extra hour or two - especially if you ride from/to Kuala Lumpur.
* [Grab](https://www.grab.com/) works everywhere in Malaysia and is cheapest (except public transport) and safest way to travel through cities.
* Also consider flying - domestic flights are very cheap - look for [AirAsia.com](https://www.airasia.com/) - usually they are the cheapest ones.
* Most facilities are cash only, however ATMs are widely available, especially in Kuala Lumpur. There is no extra charge for ATM withdrawal.

## Kuala Lumpur

* If you love oriental food, consider booking your accommodation near Jalan Alor street. It's considered one of the best food streets in KL. We booked ours in OYO 321 hostel, and if you are a backpacker looking mostly for place to sleep and take a shower - we highly recommend it. Cheap, clean with very nice staff.
* KL airport is far away from the city, and even Grab can be costly to get there. However there is a bus from centre of KL, and it routes pretty frequently. You can search it on easybook - if you stayed near Jalan Alor, look for a connection from "Pudu Sentral (Puduraya)" to KLIA or KLIA2 (if you fly with AirAsia).

### Batu Caves

* There is a train to Batu Caves leaving every half an hour, except around noon (2 hour window).
* To get there from Jalan Alor, walk to monorail station Bukit Bintang, and take a rail number 8 (light green) to KL Sentral station. Fare is 2.50RM per person. On KL Sentral take KTM train to Batu Caves - the KTM booth is well exposed, and since Batu is popular destination, all info regarding this train is also described separately. Train takes approx. 1 hour to get there, and it stops directly in front of the caves so you can't miss them.

## George Town

* If you plan to visit George Town, there are plenty of buses on Easybook available. According to schedule, the ride takes 5 hours, but don't rely on that as KL is pretty busy and getting out/to it may take some time.
* George Town can be explored by foot, however two big temples are 8km away from the city centre.
* Our hostel provided us a map with all interesting things clearly marked up, so be sure to ask for it in your accommodation as well.
* Keep in mind, that city has an airport. Consider flying to Borneo from there if you finish visiting the main island. We didn't know that, and traveled all the way back to KL, just to take a plane to Borneo.

## Borneo

* When arrive to Borneo, you will get another Malaysian visa stamp, despite you didn't leave the country - don't be suprised.

### Bako National Park

* I really recommend to stay one night in a park (or longer if you're a nature lover). There are accommodations in the park, with private or shared bathrooms. However in season park is pretty busy, so keep that in mind and book your stay in advance - you can use park website for that: <https://ebooking.sarawak.gov.my/eBooking/html/publicMobileWeb/index.html>.
* Both booking permit, and payment receipt need to be printed, so take care of that in advance. Usually hostels have printers and they can print them for you if you ask nicely. There is also a printing booth on KL Sentral station.
* To get to Bako Park, you need to get to Kuching city first. AirAsia is probably your best option.
* There is nothing to see in Kuching so you can take a Grab Taxi directly to the park (our costed us 30RM which is fairly decent price for this long ride).
* There is also a public bus number "1", which goes to the park every hour. Fare is 5RM per person.
* Getting to the entrance is a first step - to get to actual park, you need to hire a boat.
* Good news is, there is information booth with English speaking person, who can provide you all the details and how to get there.
* Also here you have to present your booking permit (if you bought it).
* Boat cost 40RM per person or 160RM per boat. If you travel with less than 4 people group and choose shared boat, you would have to wait until another travelers show up. We got very lucky and got another pair pretty fast, but this may not always be the case.
* You will also pay the park entry fee here - 20RM per person. Keep your ticket at all times, as they may be inspected in the park.
* There is also an option, to hire a guide (150 RM) who will show you a wild life and talk about it. If you're really interested, you may consider it, however we passed and saw everything we wanted to see anyway.
* Boat ride takes approx 20 minutes, and you will be dropped off on the beach. You will have to go through a water, so wear water resistant shoes if you don't want to carry them to the park.
* Finally in park - here you will receive your lodge key and a map of the park most interesting routes.
* There is also cafeter√≠a here, with selection of cold drinks and sweets. Also warm meals are served here, in three periods: Breakfast (7:30-11:30), Lunch (11:30-17:00) and Dinner (18:30-21:00). They're not super great, but they serve their purpose to fill the belly.
* There is also a night walk with a park guide at 20:00. The walk takes approx 1,5h and you can see some nocturnal life. The cost is 10RM per person. Keep in mind this is a group tour with park guide, not the one I mentioned earlier (the hired guide). Still, it's way cheaper and worth the money.
* The biggest stars of the park - the Proboscis Monkeys, have their own trail (trail number 3) - at the end of it you may see some of them.
* But also a lot of these monkeys wander around the cottages - especially houses 4 and 5. Look up on the trees and you may spot them.
* Same rules apply to the bearded pigs - they can be spotted both at the end of the trail 3 and near cottages.
* To get out of the park, agree the returning hour with the boat driver. However it may not always be the case, as our return hour was fixed - 14:00 - and we came back with different person that we came in. Keep an eye for the boats as you may be left out in the park and have to stay another night.
