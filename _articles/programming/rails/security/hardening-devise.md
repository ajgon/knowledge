# Hardening Devise

> Original article: <https://ankane.org/hardening-devise>

A few basic steps to make your [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) setup more secure !

### Send notifications for important events

Like a user changing his or her email or password. For email changes, notify the old email address to prevent quiet account takeovers (changing the email then resetting the password).

In `config/initializers/devise.rb`, set:

```ruby
config.send_email_changed_notification = true
config.send_password_change_notification = true

```

### Rate limit login attempts

Use Devise's `Lockable` module to protect individual accounts. This will lock an account after too many attempts.

Use a library like [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack) to slow down [credential stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing). This will prevent an IP address from trying to sign into many different accounts using credentials from data breaches.

Create `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb` with:

```ruby
Rack::Attack.throttle("logins/ip", limit: 20, period: 1.hour) do |req|
  req.ip if req.post? && req.path.start_with?("/users/sign_in")
end

ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("rack.attack") do |name, start, finish, request_id, req|
  puts "Throttled #{req.env["rack.attack.match_discriminator"]}"
end

```

### Record and monitor login attempts

Use [AuthTrail](https://github.com/ankane/authtrail) to record login attempts.
